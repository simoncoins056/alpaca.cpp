# Alpaca.cpp

Run a fast ChatGPT-like model locally on your device. The screencast below is not sped up and running on an M2 Macbook Air with 4GB of weights. 


[![asciicast](screencast.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/dfJ8QXZ4u978Ona59LPEldtKK)


This combines the [LLaMA foundation model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) with an [open reproduction](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) of [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) a fine-tuning of the base model to obey instructions (akin to the [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) used to train ChatGPT) and a set of modifications to [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to add a chat interface. 

## Get started

```
git clone https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp
cd alpaca.cpp

make chat
./chat
```

You can download the weights for `ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin` with BitTorrent `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:5aaceaec63b03e51a98f04fd5c42320b2a033010&dn=ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopentracker.i2p.rocks%3A6969%2Fannounce`


Alternatively you can download them with IPFS.

```
# any of these will work
wget -O ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin -c https://gateway.estuary.tech/gw/ipfs/QmQ1bf2BTnYxq73MFJWu1B7bQ2UD6qG7D7YDCxhTndVkPC
wget -O ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin -c https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ1bf2BTnYxq73MFJWu1B7bQ2UD6qG7D7YDCxhTndVkPC
wget -O ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin -c https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmQ1bf2BTnYxq73MFJWu1B7bQ2UD6qG7D7YDCxhTndVkPC
```

Save the `ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin` file in the same directory as your `./chat` executable. 

The weights are based on the published fine-tunes from `alpaca-lora`, converted back into a pytorch checkpoint with a [modified script](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/pull/19) and then quantized with llama.cpp the regular way. 

## Credit

This combines [Facebook's LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), [Stanford Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html), [alpaca-lora](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) and [corresponding weights](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b/tree/main) by Eric Wang (which uses [Jason Phang's implementation of LLaMA](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21955) on top of Hugging Face Transformers), and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) by Georgi Gerganov. The chat implementation is based on Matvey Soloviev's [Interactive Mode](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/61) for llama.cpp. Inspired by [Simon Willison's](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-7b-m2) getting started guide for LLaMA.

### Docker

#### Prerequisites
* Docker must be installed and running on your system.
* Create a folder to store big models & intermediate files (in ex. im using /llama/models)

#### Images
We have two Docker images available for this project:

1. `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full`: This image includes both the main executable file and the tools to convert LLaMA models into ggml and convert into 4-bit quantization.
2. `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:light`: This image only includes the main executable file.

#### Usage

The easiest way to download the models, convert them to ggml and optimize them is with the --all-in-one command which includes the full docker image.

 ```bash
docker run -v /llama/models:/models ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full --all-in-one "/models/" 7B
```

On complete, you are ready to play! 

```bash
docker run -v /llama/models:/models ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full --run -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512
```

or with light image:

```bash
docker run -v /llama/models:/models ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:light -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512
```

## Disclaimer

Note that the model weights are only to be used for research purposes, as they are derivative of LLaMA, and uses the published instruction data from the Stanford Alpaca project which is generated by OpenAI, which itself disallows the usage of its outputs to train competing models.
